## 1. Key Characteristics

- **Operating Voltage:**  
  - Operates within a voltage range of **4.8V to 6.0V**, ensuring compatibility with most RC control systems.

- **Speed:**  
  - At **4.8V:** approximately **0.21 seconds/60°** of rotation.
  - At **6.0V:** speed improves to around **0.16 seconds/60°**.

- **Torque:**  
  - At **4.8V:** about **45.82 oz-in** (approximately 3.3 kg-cm).
  - At **6.0V:** up to approximately **56.93 oz-in** (around 4.1 kg-cm).

- **Control System:**  
  - **Analog PWM** – the servo is controlled via a PWM signal with a period of approximately **20 ms** (50 Hz).  
  - The typical operating PWM pulse width ranges between **600 µs** and **2400 µs** (with a center pulse of around 1500 µs).  
  - The servo features a very small **deadband** of about **8 µs**, ensuring high precision.

- **Motor and Mechanical Construction:**  
  - **Motor:** A 3-pole metal brushed motor (often described as a "3-pole metal brush ferrite" motor).
  - **Gears:** Made from **nylon** (a high-efficiency resin gear train) to ensure longevity.
  - **Bearings:** Equipped with dual oilite (lubricated) bushings for excellent centering and stable output shaft performance.

- **Dimensions and Weight:**  
  - **Dimensions (Metric):** 40.6 mm (length) × 19.8 mm (width) × 36.6 mm (height)
  - **Weight:** Approximately **45.5 g** (1.6 oz)
