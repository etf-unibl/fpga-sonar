# FPGA-based sonar

## Introduction
This project implements a simple sonar device on an FPGA platform. The project uses a servo motor that continuously rotates an ultrasonic sensor across a given area, the sensor attempts to detect objects and measure their distances. The sensor's readings are processed and visualized on a standard 640x480 VGA display. The chosen FPGA platform for hosting the device is the DE1-SoC board.

## System overview
This system uses an FPGA to:
- Control an **Ultrasonic Sensor** (for distance measurement)
- Drive an **RC Servo** (to change or track angle)
- Display real-time data on a monitor via a **VGA Module** <br>

All modules are synchronized to the same system clock (**clk**) and reset (**rst**), ensuring consistent timing and operation.

## Components
### Main Controller
- **Role:** Central coordinator of the system.  
- **Key Signals:**  
  - **Angle:**  
    - Sent to the RC Servo to position it.  
    - Forwarded to the VGA Module for on-screen visualization.  
  - **Distance:**  
    - Received from the Ultrasonic Sensor.  
    - Forwarded to the VGA Module for display.
  - **Start:**
    - Initiates distance measurement in the Ultrasonic Sensor.     
- **Functionality:**  
  - Receives `distance` data from the Ultrasonic Sensor.  
  - Updates the servo `angle` to control scanning or positioning.  
  - Passes both `angle` and `distance` to the VGA Module.

### RC Servo
- **Role:** Mechanical actuator that positions based on the `angle` signal.  
- **Key Signal:**  
  - **Angle:** Received from the Main Controller.  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Interprets the `angle` command to rotate the servo accordingly.  
  - Physically adjust the Ultrasonic Sensorâ€™s orientation.

### Ultrasonic Sensor
- **Role:** Measures distance to nearby objects using ultrasonic pulses.  
- **Key Signal:**
  - **Distance:** Sent to the Main Controller.
  - **Start:** Triggers the distance measurement process.   
- **Functionality:**  
  - Sends out ultrasonic pulses and captures echoes.  
  - Calculates the time delay to determine `distance`.  
  - Provides the `distance` value to the Main Controller for further use.

### VGA Module
- **Role:** Handles video output to a monitor, showing real-time system data.  
- **Key Signals:**  
  - **Angle:** From the Main Controller, used to display servo position or scanning angle.  
  - **Distance:** From the Main Controller, used to display measured distance.  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Generates VGA timing signals (HSYNC, VSYNC, etc.).  
  - Renders graphics/text indicating the `angle` and `distance` on the screen.
